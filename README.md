Welcome to the repository for the **Tablet Test Launch Pilot Project**, conducted as part of a restaurant chain’s digital transformation initiative. This project aimed to evaluate the implementation of digital ordering tablets to improve customer experience, streamline operations, and gather feedback for full-scale rollout planning.

## 📌 Project Overview

This pilot involved the deployment of ordering tablets across two restaurant locations. The scope included technical setup, stakeholder training, customer feedback collection, and impact evaluation.
